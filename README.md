This is the JavaFX rewrite of the previous generation of our FLL scorekeeper automation program. Here is a list of features that will be included in the rewrite (More will be added over time):

Start Timer Button - Resets and starts the countdown timer when the match starts

Stop Timer Button - Stops the timer.

Toggle Display Window Button - On the display screen, you will need to supply your own Google Sheets/Excel/ect. platform to display scores. You will need to place the timer widow over this window, and when the button is pressed the timer window will hide so the spreadsheet is displayed.
(We plan to intergrate a scoring spreadsheet in the future.)

Volume Up/Down Buttons - These will fade the volume to the specified higher/lower volume.

Volume Sliders - The first slider on the left is where you can specify the volume you want to fade down to when the volume down button is pressed. The one on the right will specify the volume to fade to when the volume up button is pressed.

Color selector (THERE, BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED) - this will open a color selector menu to select a new color for the background of the timer window.

Toggle Full Screen Button - This will toggle full screen for the timer (display) window.
